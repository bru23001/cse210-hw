/*
Behaviors:

    • Displaying the starting message
    • Displaying the ending message
    • Pausing while showing a spinner for a certain number of seconds
    • Pausing while showing a countdown timer for a certain number of seconds

        ► DisplayStartingMessage() : void
        ► DisplayEndingMessage() : void
        ► ShowSpinner(seconds : int) : void
        ► ShowCountDown(second : int) : void

Attributes:

    • The activity name
    • The description
    • The duration in seconds

        ► _name : string
        ► _description : string
        ► _duration : int

Constructors:

    The base class will need to initialize all of its member variables. You 
    might require them to be passed in as parameters or you might have a 
    constructor that sets some/all to default values to be changed later.
    You could use setters or pass them to the base base class constructor 
    directly.


Based on your specifications, here's how you could define the `Activity` base class in C#:
*/
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class Activity
{
    protected string _name;
    protected string _description;
    protected int _duration;

    public Activity(string name, string description, int duration)
    {
        _name = name;
        _description = description;
        _duration = duration;
    }

    public void DisplayStartingMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Starting {_name} activity. {_description}");
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the duration in seconds: ");
        _duration = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("We'll begin in 5 seconds...");
        ShowCountDown(_duration);

        return;

    }
    public void ShowCountDown(int totalDuration)
        {
            
            int partialDuration = totalDuration/8;

            for (int i = partialDuration; i > 0; i--)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
                return;
            }
        }
    public void ShowSpinner()    
    {
        Console.Write("|"); 
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.Write("/");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.Write("--");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.Write("\\");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.Write("|");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

    }

    

    public void DisplayEndingMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You have done a good job!");
        Console.WriteLine($"You have completed the {_name} activity for {_duration} seconds.");
    }

    public static implicit operator string(Activity v)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

   // public void ShowSpinner(int seconds)
    {
        //for (int i = 0; i < seconds; i++)
        {
            Console.Write(".");
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }

    

    
}
/*
This class includes methods for displaying starting and ending messages, showing a spinner, and showing a countdown timer. The `DoActivity` method is abstract and must be implemented in each derived class. The `_name`, `_description`, and `_duration` attributes are initialized in the constructor.

Please note that this is a basic structure and does not include all of your requirements such as logging activities, ensuring no duplicate prompts/questions, saving/loading a log file, or adding animations. You would need to implement these features according to your specific needs.

Also, please remember to handle exceptions properly in your code (for example, when parsing integers), which is not shown in this basic example.
